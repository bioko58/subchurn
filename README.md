Churn Prediction in the Gaming Industry


(Description in progress - check back soon!)


Project Overview:

A gaming company sells a monthly subscription service that allows unlimited access to a cloud-hosted collection of games.  The Company wants to know what characteristics or user behaviors are strong predictors of users canceling their subscription (churn).

The Company has requested to get any information about what's causing or associated with user churn.  They are especially interested in taking these conclusions to prioritize feature development and product change to reduce user churn in the future.

Note:  some information has been modified, and details on the graphs have been obscured for confidentiality reasons.
